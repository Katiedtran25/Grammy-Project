# Grammy-Project
Grammys Project


Are you excited to dive into data work for an exciting project at The Recording Academy? You know, the non-profit organization behind the Grammy Awards!

In this project, you'll work on real data from both websites owned by The Recording Academy, the non-profit organization behind the famous Grammy Awards. As you just learned, Ray Starck, the VP of Digital Strategy, decided to split the websites into grammy.com and recordingacademy.com to better serve the Recording Academy's various audience needs.

Now, you are tasked with examining the impact of splitting up the two websites, and analyzing the data for a better understanding of trends and audience behavior on both sites.

Are you ready?!?!

Let's do this!
